GIT

Git allows us tracking the changes of any plain text!

ACCOUNT SETTINGS

- Go to https://github.com and sign in
- To configure the account in our computer, we use:
  git config --global user.name "Your name here"
  git config --global user.email "Your e-mail here"
- For show the actual account, we use:
  git config --list

To start tracking and controlling versions, follow the next steps: 

1.- Inside the selected directory, we activate the system version control of Git by executing:
 git init

2.- Change the untracked file status to staged by executing: 
git add file.extension
Or to ad all the files to the repository:
 git add . 

3.- Move file changes or updates from untracked to staged by executing: 
 git commit -m "comment something about the changes here"

If we forgot to add comment to the commit, vim appears and requires the comment. 
We type the comment in double quotes at the top of the screen and close vim presing " CTRL + SHIFT + zz" 

After doing add and commit (step 2 and 3) at least one time, we can use:
 git commit -am "comment something about the changes here"
