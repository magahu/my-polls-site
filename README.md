#MY POLLS SITE
This is public site for share and solve polls based on the "Writing your first Django app" tutorial
in the Django documentation but improve it adding a complete users interface and a more complex and safe functionality
using the Django authentication system. I developed this project in Django 3.0.7 and works with two apps: users and polls.

**Users**
The users app let people signup, login and has a basic profile. User model provides a control in votes and polls 
publication.

**Polls**
The polls app let users create and view polls also vote them, displaying poll results and see a detail about 
the poll and the user who created it.
